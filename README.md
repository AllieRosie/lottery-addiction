Estimating lottery winning chance

Link to Jupyter Notebook: [notebook](Basics.ipynb)

My estimation based on historical lottery data is that a person has:
- Less than 0.1% of winning big prize using 10,000 tickets or less.
- About 7% of winning big prize using 1,000,000 tickets.
- Highest chance of winning small prize if the ticket match 3 numbers (0.006%).
